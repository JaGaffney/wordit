## Overview

grouper is an application which automatically groups people into specified group sizes.
The unique aspect of grouper is its ability to group new people together each time. This helps when making groups
in real life repeatedly as each group will be a 'fresh' set of people together.
These Groups are not randomised but made by selecting the least grouped people of specified group size and putting them together.

It is ideal for use in classrooms, online or in person, as it helps everyone meet each other and work together at least once.

### Features

- You do not need to make accounts, Grouping data is stored in the application for future use.

- You can upload CSV files or download CSV files to make copies of grouping data or upload previous grouping data.

- You can add new members to old data even if groups were previously made.
